# PrettyScreenShot
A project that aims to become the most convenient and beautiful screenshot tool.
It can not only edit graphics on the original image.

You can also enlarge the image at the pixel level and then perform geometric drawing on it.

When saving an image, you can save both the entire image and the current view image, which means you can take a screenshot above it.
When you drag and drop a screenshot window, the background update is still visible, which was also my initial goal for this project.
